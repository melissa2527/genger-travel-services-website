            <p><strong>Words from the President, Vanessa Genger:</strong></p>
            <p>My fascination with travel began while growing up in Venezuela and Thailand. I traveled throughout Europe and the Far East with my family and as a member of the Bangkok Aquatic swim team. I fell in love with exploring the world and getting to know cities such as Athens, Rome, and Vienna.</p>

            <p>After a career in customer relations and logistics, I launched my career as a travel advisor, and have found true passion in helping my clients immerse themselves in local culture. My trips are personalized for each individual client. My areas of specialty include France, Italy, Spain, Ireland and New Zealand, and I travel often to Prague, where my daughter is a teacher.</p>

            <p>I’ve cruised Sydney Harbour in Australia, explored both islands of New Zealand, toured Italy with my three daughters during the Christmas holidays, attended Easter Mass in the Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral in Spain, and driven the northern coast of Ireland from Galway to Dublin.</p>
